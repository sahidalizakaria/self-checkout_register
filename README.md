## Self-Checkout Register

This is a not-so-simple self-checkout register program written in Python. This program is the first long python code I wrote while learning Python on Sololearn.

The code is still rough and has random words for variable names.

It also has some bugs that need to be fixed because of my shallow understanding of the programming language.
